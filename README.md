# portfolio-site

Launching My Digital Brand

This project marks my first step toward building my professional online presence as a developer. I created a personal portfolio webpage from scratch, styled it with CSS, and published it publicly using GitHub Pages.

Through this challenge, I learned essential development workflows including project setup, writing code, version control with Git, and hosting my site live on GitHub.

My goal:
To build and publish a simple but effective personal portfolio site that shows who I am, my career goals, and how to connect with me.

What I practiced:

Setting up a project folder locally

Creating and linking HTML and CSS files

Using Git and GitHub to track changes and publish code

Deploying my site with GitHub
